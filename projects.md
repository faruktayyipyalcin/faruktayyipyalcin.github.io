My research interests are broadly about morality and metascience. Below is a table that summarizes the projects I'm working on:

|----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Moral outrage and information-seeking (MS Thesis) | Morality | First stage completed | Examining how moral outrage shapes info consumption. |
| Testing the Theory of Dyadic Morality | Morality | Study design | Examining and testing assumptions of the TDM framework. |
| Pace of publication | Metascience | Data validation | Examining pace of publication in psychology and beyond. |
| Scale labels & inference | Metascience | Proposal | Examining how scale labels influence researchers' inferences. |
